The following are description of data that are being used:

- [source.json](./source.json) - Is a list of auto-responder action for users that trigger a keyword to help them solve their problem*
- [error_codes.json](./error_codes.json) - Is a list of known error codes and an action is triggered when a user executed `!error <code>` (Need help to add more information) you can see a list of error codes [here](./error_codes.md)
